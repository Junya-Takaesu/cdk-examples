# CDK Examples

## For first time deploying a stack, run the bootstrap command.

To use CDK, you need to do bootstrapping for the aws region you are trying to deploy to.
Bootstrapping needs to be done only once, so if this is the first time you deploying, you need to run below command to do that.

```
cdk bootstrap
```

This is just a repo for me to references examples of cdk stack.
